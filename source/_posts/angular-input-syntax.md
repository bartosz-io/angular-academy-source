When you use `[input]="value"` then Angular interprets the value as an expression. So you can place there a variable reference from the component or even mathematic formula. When you use `input="value"` then the value is interpreted as a string! Take a look at the example:

{% asset_img "syntax.png" "Angular Input Syntax" %}
