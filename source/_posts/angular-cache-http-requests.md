Below code presents how to cache HTTP requests in Angular!
First, we just need to execute a regular HTTP query (for ex. get) and pipe the stream through **shareReplay** operator! This transforms the initial stream to a ReplaySubject! In other words, new subscriptions will NOT execute other HTTP requests but a cached value will be used. If you want to get the fresh value just create another HTTP stream without shareReplay operator and subscribe to it.

{% asset_img "shareReplay.png" "ShareReplay" %}
