This is **Angular Knowledge Pill** - short and concise article! ðŸ’Š
It takes just 10 seconds to learn something new ðŸ”¥
Like taking your morning vitamins ðŸ˜ƒ

Imagine you are building an application with three modules:
- **main** module,
- **records** module (lazy loaded feature module),
- **settings** module (lazy loaded feature module).

Now, you would like to know how much do those modules contribute to the whole application size! Using a webpack-bundle-analyzer it is more than easy! Take a look at how to analyze your application bundles below.

{% asset_img "analyzer.png" "Analyzer" %}

This will give you a very detailed overview of your application. You can see how much do the final JavaScript bundles weight and how their sizes refer to each other! The colored diagram below is constructed this way that the bigger the given rectangle the heavier the particular bundle!

{% asset_img "files.png" "Files" %}

{% asset_img "bundle.png" "Bundle" %}
